Drug-target interactions (DTIs) play a crucial role in drug discovery and pharmacology. However, their experimental determination is time-consuming and limited. Unwanted or unexpected DTIs could cause severe side effects. Therefore, the creation of machine learning models that can quickly and confidently predict whether thousands of drugs and proteins bind together and how much is crucial. 

The project aimed to create a new curated dataset of DTIs and then use this dataset to train machine learning models. Our models were split into two categories, baseline and enhanced, with baseline using just the drug and protein sequence descriptors and the enhanced using our protein structural embeddings derived from AlphaFold's predictions in addition to those descriptors. 

The created embeddings proved to be ineffective. However, our trained models could still prove useful in uncovering interesting relationships that could be investigated further.
