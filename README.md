# Linking QSAR-Based Drug Target Prediction with AlphaFold
DeepMind recently published a vast set of supposedly high-accurate predictions of protein structures. These protein structures could be invaluable for identifying new uses for existing drugs known as drug repurposing. Quantitative structure-relationship activity (QSAR) is a method to use simpler descriptors of molecules as features to make predictions about activity, for example drug binding. This project would look at ways to create descriptors for the AlphaFold proteins that can be used with drug descriptors to make predictions of drug binding. Practically, it would likely involve some deep learning to process the 3D structure data and learn embeddings that can be used in further machine learning prediction. There are several possible steps in this pipeline so the project would be fairly flexible in which parts to target.
